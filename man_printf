.SH NAME
_printf \- a basic replica of the standard printf function

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include \(dqmain.h\(dq

.BI "int _printf(const char *" "format, ..." ");"

.SH DESCRIPTION
Write output to stdout using the format string. The format string is comprised of 0 or more directives and contains specifiers beginning with the character \(dq%\(dq. The specifier use the corresponding argument to print the variable.

.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, \fB_printf\fR returns the number of bytes printed, excluding the null byte. On failure, returns -1.

.SH SPECIFERS
.TP
d, i
The int argument is printed in signed decimal notation
.TP
u
The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is printed in unsigned decimal notation
.TP
o
The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is printed in unsigned octal notation
.TP
x, X
The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is printed in unsigned hexadecimal notation. The letters \(dqabcdef\(dq are used for x; the letters \(dqABCDEF\(dq are used for X.
.TP
b
The \fIunsigned int\fR argument is printed in unsigned binary notation.
.TP
c
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an \fIunsigned char\fR and printed.
.TP
s
The \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array. Characters up to, but not including, the terminating null byte are written
.TP
%
A '%' is written. No argument is converted.
.TP
p
The \fIvoid *\fR pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal format beginning with '0x'.
.TP
r
The \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array. Characters are written in reverse order up to, but not including, the terminating null byte.
.TP
R
The \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to a character array. Characters are encoded into ROT13 and written up to, but not including, the terminating null byte.
.TP
F
Regardless of what is passed to the function, this specifier only prints an expletive.


.SH EXAMPLE
To print text mixed with a \fIname\fR string variable and an \fIage\fR integer variable:
.PP
.nf
.RS
#include "main.h"
#include <string.h>

int main(int ac, char **av)
{
	int age;
	char *name;

	if (ac != 3)
	   return (-1);

	name = av[1];
	age = atoi(av[2]);

	_printf("Hello! My name is %s and I am %d years old.\n", name, age);

	return (0);
}
.fi
.PP
